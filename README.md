# Using Theorem Proving, one of the Formal Methods approaches for proving Equivalence of Application based Storage systems.


This partial research based project was done as a part of the Formal verification course taken by Prof. Alan Hu in University of British Columbia.

It was a challenging course, however, it is a course worth taking for every student interested in understanding techniques available for finding bugs in a system. Nowdays, software bugs are giving way to numerous number of security vulnerabilities. 

One of the main causes of this is in two words - BAD PROGRAMMING.

Hence formal methods have a great economic benefit as they largely help in finding the security bugs. However, in order to use formal methods, a deep understanding of systems, theoretical computer science is requires. 

The summary of the partial research work I conducted as a part of the project was:

1) Used Why3 ( http://why3.lri.fr/) , an amazing tool developed by INRIA. Please refer the report in order to understand more about the tool.

2) Learned OCaml as a part of the project. ( Had never used ML type language before this, hence enjoyed it)

3) Studied the underlying structure of storage systems used these days and the Data structures used.

4) Tried to prove their equivalence using theorem proving and understood why it was a good or not so good approach. ( Refer the report in order to understand more)
